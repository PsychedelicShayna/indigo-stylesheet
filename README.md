# Indigo QSS Stylesheet
I initially made this stylesheet for my cursor-locker application, but I've been using it throughout my Qt projects, and think it deserves its own repository at this point. Indigo, as the name would suggest, is purpleish blueish dark stylesheet, meant to look sleek, colorful, yet not too in your face. Screenshots coming soon.
